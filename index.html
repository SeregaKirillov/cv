    As a result of having passed through The Gate and witnessing the Truth, Edward became one of the few alchemists who does
    not require a drawn Transmutation Circle to perform alchemical transmutations. By merely touching his palms together, he
    creates an energy circulation with his arms and transmutes by using his own will as a substitute for the necessary runes.
    This remarkable talent makes his transmutations both instantaneous and incredibly versatile, allowing him to use alchemy to
    its fullest potential in direct combat. In the 2003 anime, Edward was initially unaware of his new talent and continued to
    draw transmutation circles when performing alchemy, but after he accidentally used this ability to heat water to comfort the
    pregnant Gracia Hughes, he ended up using it regularly. In the 2003 anime, his skill with transmutation increased to the point he
    could transform his automail arm into a functional gatling gun for battle, as seen during his fight with Sloth.<br>With this quick
    style, Edward becomes a master of his surroundings and uses the substances therein to supplement his physical prowess in battle - creating
    giant earthen hands to lift objects, columns of stone to gain himself the higher ground and ogre-faced battering rams with which to strike
    opponents. Ed also specializes in transmuting weapons with which to do battle and often crafts menacing-looking swords and ostentatious lances
    when necessary, but his primary weapon is his automail right arm, whose forearm plating he transmutes into various blades.
